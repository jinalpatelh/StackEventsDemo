# Descrition
The class will mimic a stack data structure and expose two events 
1) when an item is push on the stack 
2) when an item is popped off the stack.
Internally in the class the stack will be represented with a List<T> structure but externally it will mimic a stack (last-in-first-out).
The data items the stack contains must be assignable by the developer using the class (e.g. generic).
Clients listening for the push and pop events will write out to the console that an item has been added and an item has been removed respectively.
